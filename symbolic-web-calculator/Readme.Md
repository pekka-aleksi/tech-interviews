Django + REST API: Symbolic Calculator
===

This was a technical interview with an emphasis on Django.

The idea was to build a simple web page with a symbolic calculator in the backend.

This application provides that.

Install the dependencies and run `python manage.py runserver`

Then you should be able to access `http://localhost:8000/calculator/`
